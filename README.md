# rofi-AppImage

Unofficial AppImage of [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

rofi-theme-selector is called this way: `./appimagename rofi-theme-selector`. 

You can also run the `rofi-appimage.sh` script in your machine to make the AppImage, provided it has all the dependencies needed to build rofi.

It is possible that these appimages may fail to work with appimagelauncher, since appimagelauncher is pretty much dead I recommend this alternative: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead.
